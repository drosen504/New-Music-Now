**Spotify Credentials (if you don't have your own account):**

Email: the.defenestrastor@gmail.com

Password: NewMusicNow

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this app is to, with minimal input, recommend a new band that you might enjoy. ["Overchoice"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice) can occur when too many options are provided at once, like having 8 brands of peanut butter at the grocery store or 40 different online full stack programming courses to choose from. The "Related Artists" section of music services like Spotify or last.fm are another example of this. You want something new to listen to, but deciding which band to delve into can be daunting. New Music Now! is here to help.


**Summary:**

A Spotify account is required to utilize New Music Now! (either free or premium is fine). If you do not have a Spotify Account, I've provided credentials for you to use up above. The user is first prompted to login to Spotify. After doing so they are asked to enter the name of a band/artist that they like. They will then be presented with a single song from a related artist and asked to listen to it by hitting the play button on Spotify Play Button widget. They are then asked if they like it or don't like it. If they indicate yes, a link to the artist's Spotify page is presented. If they indicate no, a new song/artist related to their query will populate for them to listen to. They also have the option of starting over and entering a new artist.
